# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering  
Unsupervised Machine Learning | Customer Behaviour Analysis

This project performs **Customer Segmentation** using the **K-Means clustering** algorithm.  
Segmentation helps businesses understand different customer groups so they can make  
better marketing and product decisions.

---

## Project Overview
- Load and explore customer data  
- Visualize purchase patterns  
- Scale the features  
- Apply **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters  
- Train the **K-Means Clustering** model  
- Visualize customer clusters  
- Interpret customer groups  

---

## Machine Learning Algorithm Used
### **K-Means Clustering**
- Unsupervised ML algorithm  
- Partitions customers into K distinct groups  
- Creates groups based on similarity in spending and income behavior  

---

## Features Used (Example)
- Annual Income  
- Spending Score  
- Age  
- Gender  
(Depends on your dataset)

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning  
2. Feature Scaling (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler)  
3. Finding optimal K using Elbow Method  
4. Applying K-Means clustering  
5. Cluster Visualization using Matplotlib

## Cluster Visualization
Scatter plots showing different customer segments based on income & spending score.  
Helps businesses understand:
- High-value customers  
- Low-spending customers  
- Target customers for ads or offers
